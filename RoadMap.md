## üöÄ Module Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies
```
Foundation ‚Üí User Management ‚Üí Real-time Gaming ‚Üí Game Enhancement ‚Üí Social Features ‚Üí Blockchain ‚Üí Production
```

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- **Security modules** can be developed alongside core features
- **Game customization** can be implemented parallel to AI development
- **Stats dashboard** can be built while other features generate data
- **Blockchain integration** can be developed independently once core game is stable
