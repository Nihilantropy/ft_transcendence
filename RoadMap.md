## üê≥ Docker-First Development Pattern

Each phase follows this strict pattern:

### 1. Documentation & Specification
- Service architecture design
- API contracts definition
- Technology stack decisions
- Database schema (if needed)

### 2. Docker Infrastructure
- Add service to `docker-compose.yml`
- Create service `Dockerfile`
- Configure networking and volumes
- Environment variables setup

### 3. Core Implementation
- Implement service functionality
- Add health checks
- Basic error handling
- Service-to-service communication

### 4. Integration & Testing
