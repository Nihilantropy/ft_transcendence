// Utility re-exports for convenience
export type { Theme, GameMode, GameStatus } from './global.types'
export type { ApiResponse, ApiError, HttpMethod, ResponseStatus } from './api.types'
export type { GameState, BallState, PaddleState, Score, GameEvent } from './game.types'
export type { UserProfile, UserStats, Achievement, GameHistory } from './user.types'
export type { RouteConfig, RouteHandler, NavigationOptions } from './router.types'

// This allows clean imports like:
// import { User, Game, ApiResponse } from '@/types'
// import { GameState, UserStats } from '@/types'
// import type { RouteHandler, GameEvent } from '@/types'
