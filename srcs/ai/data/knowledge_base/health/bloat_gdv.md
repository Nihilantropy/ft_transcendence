# Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat/GDV) in Dogs

## Overview
GDV (bloat) is a life-threatening emergency where the stomach fills with gas and twists on itself, cutting off blood supply. Requires immediate surgery. Without treatment, death occurs within hours. Mortality rate: 10-30% even with treatment.

## Breeds at Highest Risk
- **Large, deep-chested breeds**:
  - Great Dane (42% lifetime risk)
  - German Shepherd
  - Standard Poodle
  - Rottweiler
  - Doberman Pinscher
  - Irish Setter
  - Weimaraner
  - Saint Bernard
  - Bloodhound

## Risk Factors
- Deep, narrow chest conformation
- Large breed size (over 50 lbs)
- Eating one large meal daily
- Eating too quickly
- Exercise immediately before/after meals
- Stress or anxiety during feeding
- Family history of bloat
- Age (risk increases with age)
- Male dogs slightly higher risk

## Symptoms (EMERGENCY)
**Early signs**:
- Restlessness, pacing
- Excessive drooling
- Attempting to vomit (dry heaving, unproductive retching)
- Swollen, tight abdomen
- Looking at abdomen or flank

**Progressive signs**:
- Rapid heart rate
- Weak pulse
- Pale gums
- Difficulty breathing
- Collapse
- Shock

## Emergency Protocol
1. **Call vet immediately** - do NOT wait to see if symptoms improve
2. Transport to emergency vet as quickly as possible
3. Do NOT give food, water, or medication
4. Keep dog calm and quiet during transport
5. Every minute counts - mortality increases with time

## Treatment
**Immediate stabilization**:
- IV fluids for shock
- Stomach decompression (tube or needle)
- Pain medication

**Surgery** (required in almost all cases):
- Untwist stomach
- Assess tissue damage (remove dead tissue if needed)
- Gastropexy (permanently attach stomach to prevent recurrence)
- Surgery must occur within 6 hours for best outcomes

## Prevention Strategies
**Feeding**:
- Feed 2-3 small meals daily instead of one large meal
- Use slow-feeder bowls or puzzle feeders
- Avoid elevated feeding bowls (contrary to old advice)
- Don't allow rapid eating
- Measure food portions

**Exercise**:
- Wait 1 hour before exercise after meals
- Wait 1 hour after exercise before feeding
- Avoid vigorous play around mealtimes

**Stress Reduction**:
- Feed in calm, quiet environment
- Separate dogs during feeding if multiple pets
- Consistent feeding schedule

**Surgical Prevention**:
- Prophylactic gastropexy for high-risk breeds (during spay/neuter)
- 95% effective at preventing GDV
- Recommended for Great Danes and other highest-risk breeds

## Prognosis
- **With rapid treatment**: 80-90% survival
- **Delayed treatment** (>6 hours): 50% survival
- **No treatment**: 100% fatal within hours
- **Recurrence without gastropexy**: 70-80% will bloat again
- **Recurrence with gastropexy**: <5%

## Post-Surgery Care
- Hospital stay 2-5 days
- Pain management
- Gradual return to normal feeding
- Monitor for arrhythmias (48 hours post-surgery)
- Permanent feeding/exercise modifications
- Excellent prognosis if no complications

## Know Your Emergency Vet
- Locate 24-hour emergency vet BEFORE emergency
- Keep phone number readily available
- Know the route and drive time
- Have backup transportation plan
- Consider pet insurance (surgery costs $2,000-$7,000)
