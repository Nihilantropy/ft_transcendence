# Brachycephalic Syndrome in Dogs

## Overview
Brachycephalic Syndrome is a collection of upper airway abnormalities found in flat-faced (brachycephalic) dog breeds. It causes breathing difficulties ranging from mild to life-threatening and affects quality of life.

## Affected Breeds
- Bulldogs (English, French)
- Pugs
- Boston Terriers
- Shih Tzus
- Boxers
- Pekingese
- Cavalier King Charles Spaniels

## Anatomical Abnormalities
- **Stenotic Nares**: Narrowed nostrils restricting airflow
- **Elongated Soft Palate**: Excess tissue blocking airway
- **Hypoplastic Trachea**: Abnormally narrow windpipe
- **Everted Laryngeal Saccules**: Tissue sucked into airway

## Symptoms
- Noisy breathing (snorting, snoring, wheezing)
- Exercise intolerance
- Cyanosis (blue tongue/gums) during activity
- Gagging or retching
- Fainting or collapse
- Heat intolerance
- Sleep apnea

## Risk Factors
- Obesity (worsens breathing significantly)
- Hot/humid weather
- Overexertion
- Stress or excitement
- Anesthesia

## Prevention and Management
- Maintain lean body weight
- Avoid heat and humidity
- Use harness instead of collar
- Short, controlled exercise sessions
- Air conditioning essential
- Elevate food/water bowls
- Avoid stressful situations

## Treatment Options
- **Medical**: Weight loss, anti-inflammatory drugs, oxygen therapy
- **Surgical**: Nostril widening, soft palate resection, saccule removal
- **Emergency**: Oxygen, cooling, sedation, possible tracheostomy

## When to Seek Emergency Care
- Blue or purple gums/tongue
- Excessive panting that won't stop
- Collapse or loss of consciousness
- Inability to cool down after mild activity
- Extreme difficulty breathing

## Long-Term Prognosis
- Mild cases: Manageable with lifestyle modifications
- Moderate cases: May benefit from surgery
- Severe cases: Require surgery, ongoing monitoring
- Progressive condition - worsens with age
