# Yorkshire Terrier

## Overview
Yorkshire Terriers (Yorkies) are feisty, affectionate toy dogs with glamorous coats. Despite their tiny size, they have big personalities and were originally bred to catch rats in clothing mills in Yorkshire, England.

## Temperament
- **Affectionate**: Devoted to owners, loves attention
- **Feisty**: Bold and brave despite small size
- **Energetic**: Active and playful
- **Alert**: Excellent watchdogs, will bark at strangers
- **Tenacious**: True terrier spirit, can be stubborn

## Physical Characteristics
- **Size**: Toy (4-7 lbs, 7-8 inches tall)
- **Coat**: Long, silky, straight, hypoallergenic (minimal shedding)
- **Colors**: Blue and tan (born black, color develops over time)
- **Lifespan**: 12-15 years

## Health Considerations
- **Dental Disease**: Major issue in small breeds, daily brushing essential
- **Luxating Patella**: Kneecap dislocation, causes limping
- **Tracheal Collapse**: Windpipe weakness, causes coughing
- **Hypoglycemia**: Low blood sugar, especially in puppies
- **Portosystemic Shunt**: Liver condition
- **Legg-Calvé-Perthes Disease**: Hip joint disorder
- **Eye Problems**: Cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy

## Care Requirements
- **Exercise**: 30 minutes daily, indoor play sufficient
- **Grooming**: Daily brushing essential to prevent matting
- **Dental Care**: Daily tooth brushing, professional cleanings
- **Temperature Protection**: Sensitive to cold, may need sweaters
- **Socialization**: Prevent "small dog syndrome" through training

## Grooming Requirements
- Daily brushing prevents tangles and mats
- Professional grooming every 6-8 weeks
- Common clips: Puppy cut, show coat (floor-length)
- Regular eye cleaning to prevent staining
- Ear hair plucking to prevent infections
- Nail trimming every 2-3 weeks

## Special Considerations
- Fragile - supervise around young children
- Use harness instead of collar (prevents tracheal collapse)
- Cannot jump from high surfaces safely
- House training can be challenging
- Prone to separation anxiety
- May be aggressive toward larger dogs (lacks self-awareness of size)

## Nutrition Recommendations
- Toy breed formula with small kibble
- 3-4 small meals daily to prevent hypoglycemia
- High-quality protein (minimum 25-30%)
- Avoid table scraps and human food
- Dental-friendly treats and chews
- Monitor weight - obesity worsens joint/breathing issues

## Warning Signs Requiring Vet Care
- Coughing, gagging, or honking sounds (tracheal collapse)
- Limping or holding up back leg (luxating patella)
- Weakness, trembling, confusion (hypoglycemia)
- Difficulty eating, bad breath (dental disease)
