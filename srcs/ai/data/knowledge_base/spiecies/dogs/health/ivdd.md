# Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) in Dogs

## Overview
IVDD occurs when the cushioning discs between vertebrae bulge or rupture, pressing on the spinal cord. It causes pain, nerve damage, and potentially paralysis. Dachshunds have a 25% lifetime risk.

## Breeds at Highest Risk
- **Chondrodystrophic breeds** (short legs, long backs):
  - Dachshund (25% lifetime risk)
  - Corgi
  - Basset Hound
  - Beagle
  - Shih Tzu
  - French Bulldog
- **Large breeds** (age-related):
  - German Shepherd
  - Labrador Retriever

## Types
- **Type I**: Acute disc rupture, sudden paralysis (young/middle-aged, chondrodystrophic breeds)
- **Type II**: Gradual disc degeneration, chronic pain (older, large breeds)

## Symptoms by Severity
**Grade 1 (Mild)**: Pain, hunched back, reluctance to move
**Grade 2 (Moderate)**: Weakness, wobbly gait, knuckling paws
**Grade 3 (Severe)**: Unable to walk but can move legs
**Grade 4 (Critical)**: Paralysis, cannot move legs
**Grade 5 (Emergency)**: Paralysis + no deep pain sensation (surgical emergency within 24 hours)

## Warning Signs
- Yelping when picked up or touched
- Hunched or arched back
- Reluctance to jump or climb stairs
- Trembling or shaking
- Knuckling (dragging toes)
- Loss of coordination
- Inability to urinate or defecate

## Risk Factors
- Genetics (hereditary in Dachshunds)
- Obesity (doubles the risk)
- Jumping from heights
- Stair climbing
- Rough play
- Age (3-7 years for Type I)

## Prevention
- Maintain lean body weight
- Use ramps instead of stairs
- Prevent jumping on/off furniture
- Proper lifting technique (support chest AND rear)
- Harness instead of collar
- Regular low-impact exercise
- Consider glucosamine supplements

## Treatment Options
**Conservative (Grades 1-2)**:
- Strict crate rest (4-6 weeks)
- Anti-inflammatory medications
- Pain management
- Physical therapy after rest period

**Surgical (Grades 3-5)**:
- Hemilaminectomy (remove bone pressing on spinal cord)
- Must be performed within 24-48 hours for Grade 5
- 90% success rate if deep pain sensation present
- 50% success rate if deep pain absent (Grade 5)

## Recovery and Prognosis
- Grade 1-2: 70-90% recover with rest alone
- Grade 3: 50% recover conservatively, 90% with surgery
- Grade 4: Surgery usually required, good prognosis
- Grade 5: Emergency surgery critical, 50% recover if done within 24 hours

## Post-Recovery Care
- Gradual return to activity over 2-3 months
- Continued weight management
- Permanent activity restrictions (no jumping)
- Physical therapy/hydrotherapy
- Lifetime risk of recurrence (20% within 2 years)

## EMERGENCY PROTOCOL
If sudden paralysis or loss of deep pain (no response to toe pinch):
1. Restrict movement immediately (crate rest)
2. Emergency vet visit within hours
3. Do NOT give human pain medication
4. Every hour counts for surgical success
