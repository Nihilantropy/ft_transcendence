# Dachshund

## Overview
Dachshunds are clever, lively, and courageous dogs with distinctive long bodies and short legs. Originally bred in Germany to hunt badgers (name means "badger dog"), they come in three coat varieties and two sizes.

## Temperament
- **Brave**: Fearless despite small size
- **Clever**: Intelligent but can be stubborn
- **Lively**: Energetic and playful
- **Loyal**: Devoted to family, can be one-person dogs
- **Vocal**: Alert barkers, excellent watchdogs

## Physical Characteristics
- **Sizes**: 
  - Standard: 16-32 lbs
  - Miniature: Under 11 lbs
- **Coat Types**: Smooth, Longhaired, Wirehaired
- **Colors**: Red, black/tan, chocolate, cream, dapple, piebald
- **Build**: Long-bodied, short-legged
- **Lifespan**: 12-16 years

## Health Considerations
- **Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD)**: 25% risk, can cause paralysis
- **Obesity**: Extra weight severely stresses spine
- **Dental Disease**: Common in small breeds
- **Luxating Patella**: Kneecap dislocation
- **Progressive Retinal Atrophy**: Eye disease
- **Epilepsy**: Genetic predisposition
- **Diabetes**: Higher risk than average

## Care Requirements
- **Exercise**: 30-60 minutes daily, avoid jumping/stairs
- **Spine Protection**: Use ramps, prevent jumping on/off furniture
- **Grooming**: Varies by coat type (smooth: weekly, long/wire: 2-3x weekly)
- **Training**: Early socialization, positive reinforcement
- **Weight Management**: CRITICAL for spine health

## Special Spine Protection Measures
- **NEVER** allow jumping from furniture or heights
- Install ramps for all elevated surfaces
- Carry up/down stairs whenever possible
- Proper support when picking up (support chest AND hindquarters)
- Avoid activities that twist spine
- Maintain lean body weight (obesity doubles IVDD risk)
- Watch for early warning signs: reluctance to move, hunched back

## Coat-Specific Care
- **Smooth**: Weekly brushing, occasional baths
- **Longhaired**: Brush 2-3x weekly, monthly grooming
- **Wirehaired**: Hand-stripping 2x yearly, regular brushing

## Training Considerations
- Independent thinkers, can be stubborn
- Housebreaking can be challenging
- Tend to bark - needs training
- Strong prey drive (bred to hunt)
- May not get along with other small pets
- Can develop "small dog syndrome" without boundaries

## Nutrition Recommendations
- High-quality small breed formula
- Strict portion control (obesity is the #1 preventable risk)
- Feed twice daily
- Avoid table scraps and high-fat foods
- Consider joint supplements (glucosamine)
- Monitor weight weekly

## IVDD Warning Signs (EMERGENCY)
- Reluctance to move or jump
- Hunched back or neck
- Yelping when touched
- Weakness or paralysis in legs
- Loss of bladder/bowel control
- Dragging legs

**If any IVDD symptoms occur: Crate rest immediately and emergency vet visit within hours - time is critical for recovery**
