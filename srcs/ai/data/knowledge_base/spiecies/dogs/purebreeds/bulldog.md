# Bulldog (English Bulldog)

## Overview
Bulldogs are gentle, dignified, and courageous companions. Despite their muscular, intimidating appearance, they are among the gentlest of dogs. Their distinctive wrinkled face and pushed-in nose make them iconic.

## Temperament
- **Gentle**: Patient and kind, especially with children
- **Courageous**: Brave despite calm demeanor
- **Friendly**: Loves human companionship
- **Dignified**: Calm, composed personality
- **Stubborn**: Can be willful during training

## Physical Characteristics
- **Size**: Medium (40-50 lbs, 14-15 inches tall)
- **Build**: Wide, muscular, low-slung
- **Coat**: Short, smooth, fine-textured
- **Colors**: Brindle, white, red, fawn, piebald
- **Lifespan**: 8-10 years

## Health Considerations
- **Brachycephalic Syndrome**: Severe breathing difficulties
- **Heat Stroke**: Cannot tolerate heat, prone to overheating
- **Hip Dysplasia**: Common due to body structure
- **Cherry Eye**: Prolapsed tear gland
- **Skin Fold Dermatitis**: Wrinkles require daily cleaning
- **Cardiac Issues**: Higher risk of heart problems
- **Respiratory Distress**: Requires emergency vet intervention

## Care Requirements
- **Exercise**: Short walks only, avoid overexertion
- **Climate Control**: Air conditioning essential, avoid heat/humidity
- **Grooming**: Daily wrinkle cleaning with damp cloth
- **Diet**: Obesity prevention critical
- **Breathing Monitoring**: Watch for signs of respiratory distress

## Special Considerations
- Cannot swim - will sink due to body structure
- Anesthesia carries higher risk
- Often require cesarean sections for breeding
- May need surgery to correct breathing issues (soft palate, nostrils)
- Snoring and snorting are normal
- Cannot be outdoor dogs - need climate control

## Nutrition Recommendations
- Small, frequent meals to reduce digestive stress
- Elevated feeding bowls may help with swallowing
- High-quality, easily digestible food
- Avoid exercise immediately after eating
- Maintain lean body weight (obesity worsens breathing)

## Warning Signs Requiring Immediate Vet Care
- Excessive panting or gasping
- Blue/purple tongue or gums
- Collapse during/after exercise
- Vomiting or gagging repeatedly
- Inability to cool down after mild activity
