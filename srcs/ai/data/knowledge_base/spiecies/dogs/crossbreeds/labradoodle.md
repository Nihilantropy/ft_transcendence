# Labradoodle (Labrador Retriever × Poodle)

## Overview
Labradoodles are the original designer doodle breed, first bred in Australia in 1989 for hypoallergenic guide dogs. They combine the Labrador's friendly nature with the Poodle's intelligence and low-shedding coat.

## Visual Identification Markers

### Definitive Physical Traits
- **Coat Texture**: Wavy, curly, or fleece-like
  - "Fleece" coat: Soft, wavy (most desirable)
  - "Wool" coat: Tight curls like Poodle
  - "Hair" coat: Straight, sheds (less common, F1)
- **Coat Colors**: Chocolate, black, cream, apricot, red, parti-color
  - Chocolate and black most common (Labrador colors)
- **Build**: Athletic, sturdy, well-balanced
  - More muscular than Goldendoodle
  - Broader chest than Poodle
- **Face**: Broader muzzle than Poodle, shorter than Labrador
- **Ears**: Floppy, medium length

### Size Variations
- **Standard Labradoodle**: 50-65 lbs, 21-24 inches (Standard Poodle)
- **Medium Labradoodle**: 30-45 lbs, 17-20 inches (Moyen Poodle)
- **Miniature Labradoodle**: 15-25 lbs, 14-16 inches (Miniature Poodle)

## Detection Heuristics for Vision AI

**High Likelihood Indicators:**
1. **Labrador probability: 0.45-0.65** AND **Poodle probability: 0.40-0.60**
2. Chocolate or black wavy/curly coat
3. Stockier build than Goldendoodle
4. Broader head and muzzle
5. Athletic, muscular body with curly coat (trait conflict)

**Trait Conflicts Suggesting Cross-Breed:**
- Poodle curly coat + Labrador body type
- Chocolate coloring + wavy/curly texture
- Shorter muzzle than Lab + broader than Poodle

## Generation Types

### F1 (50% Labrador / 50% Poodle)
- Moderate shedding (more than later generations)
- Straighter to wavy coat
- Strong hybrid vigor
- Most variable coat type

### F1B (75% Poodle / 25% Labrador)
- Curlier, more hypoallergenic
- Minimal shedding
- Lighter build
- Better for allergy sufferers

### Australian Labradoodle (Multigenerational)
- Bred for consistency over multiple generations
- Includes Cocker Spaniel in some lines
- Most predictable coat and temperament
- Recognized as distinct breed in Australia

## Temperament (Inherited Traits)

### From Labrador Retriever:
- Outgoing and friendly
- High food motivation
- Love of swimming and retrieving
- Gentle with children
- Eager to please

### From Poodle:

## Health Considerations

### Common to Both Parents:
- **Hip Dysplasia**: Screen parents before breeding
- **Elbow Dysplasia**: Less common but possible
- **Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)**: Eye disease
- **Ear Infections**: Floppy ears + water-loving = frequent risk

### Labrador-Inherited:
- **Obesity**: Highly food-motivated, weight management critical
- **Exercise-Induced Collapse (EIC)**: Rare in crosses

### Poodle-Inherited:
- **Addison's Disease**: Adrenal gland disorder
- **Sebaceous Adenitis**: Skin condition affecting coat

### Hybrid Vigor:
- Generally healthier than purebreds
- Lower cancer risk than Labradors

## Care Requirements

### Exercise:
- **Daily Needs**: 1-2 hours vigorous activity
- **Favorite Activities**: Swimming, fetch, running, hiking
- **Mental Stimulation**: Puzzle toys, nose work, obedience
- Inherited high energy from both parents

### Grooming:
- **Brushing**: 3-5 times weekly (daily for wool coats)
- **Professional Grooming**: Every 6-8 weeks
- **Bathing**: As needed (water-loving = frequent baths needed)
- **Ear Cleaning**: Weekly minimum (prone to infections)
- **Nail Trimming**: Every 3-4 weeks

### Training:
- Extremely trainable (top-tier intelligence)
- Excel in service work, therapy, search and rescue
- Positive reinforcement essential
- Early socialization prevents overenthusiasm

## Nutrition Recommendations
- High-quality protein (minimum 25% for active dogs)
- **Portion control critical**: Labrador food motivation inherited
- Avoid free-feeding (prone to obesity)
- Size-appropriate formula:
  - Standard: Large breed
  - Medium/Mini: Small/medium breed
- Glucosamine/chondroitin for joint health
- Omega-3 for coat health

## Comparison: Labradoodle vs Goldendoodle

| Feature | Labradoodle | Goldendoodle |

## Common Misconceptions

❌ **"Labradoodles are hypoallergenic"**
✅ F1B and multigenerational are better for allergies, not guaranteed

❌ **"They don't need much exercise"**
✅ Very high exercise needs (both parents are working breeds)

❌ **"All Labradoodles look the same"**
✅ Coat type and appearance highly variable, especially F1

❌ **"They're easy to groom"**
✅ High-maintenance grooming, more than either parent

## Lifespan
12-14 years

## Recommendations for Owners

**Best For:**
- Active families who can provide 2+ hours daily activity
- Those seeking service/therapy dog potential
- Allergy sufferers (F1B or Australian Labradoodle)
- Experienced dog owners who can manage energy

**Not Ideal For:**
- Sedentary households
- Those wanting low-maintenance grooming
- People with limited time for training/exercise
- Homes without access to water for swimming

## Historical Significance
The Labradoodle was the first intentional "designer breed" created by Wally Conron in Australia (1989) for the Royal Guide Dog Association of Australia, aiming to combine hypoallergenic coat with guide dog temperament.
